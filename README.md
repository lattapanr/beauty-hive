# Beauty Hive

Beauty Hive is a responsive, modern, and minimalistic website that displays makeup products sourced from the MakeupAPI. The website allows users to search for products by brand and browse products categorized by face, eye, and lips. This project focuses on improving API call skills by fetching data directly from the source and optimizing calls by targeting specific endpoints to prevent overload and slow data fetching. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to practice using React Router for navigation. The project is built using Vite with React and vanilla CSS.
