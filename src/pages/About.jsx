      <h2>What it is</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to this proundly designed, responsive website! This is a beauty
        lover's dream come true! Here, you'll discover an incredible array of
        makeup products sourced from the Makeup API. This site boasts a sleek

      <h2>What it offers</h2>
      <p>
        Every product showcased here acts as a gateway to its brand's page,
        treating you to detailed information, helpful customer reviews, and the
        convenience of making purchases. While the newsletter and social media
        sections may be static, they bring an authentic blog-like feel to the
        experience, making you feel right at home.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
      <p>
        Not only does this project offer a chance for me to sharpen my React
        skills, but it also allows me to dive into React Router implementation
        and API integration. I'm thrilled to have you join me on this exciting
        journey, where technology and beauty harmoniously blend together!
      </p>

      <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
      <p>
        When you click on a product to make a purchase, you might notice that
        some of the product links have been taken down by the owner. It could be
        because they no longer sell those products.
